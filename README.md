# Garbage-classification-with-MobileNetV2

Overview
This repository contains a garbage sorting model implemented using the MobileNetV2 architecture. The model is trained to classify images into 12 different categories representing various types of garbage.

Model Architecture
MobileNetV2 Base: The model utilizes the MobileNetV2 architecture as its base, followed by a Global Average Pooling layer.

Dense Layer: A Dense layer with 12 output nodes for classification.

Training
The model is trained for 20 epochs, achieving a peak validation accuracy of 90.14%. The training process involves optimizing the categorical crossentropy loss using the Adam optimizer.

Usage
The trained model weights are saved in the repository.
Use the provided notebook to load the model and make predictions on new images.

Results
Peak Validation Accuracy: 90.14%
Training Time: Approximately 1 hour.
Feel free to explore the notebook for more details on the model architecture, training process, and usage.
